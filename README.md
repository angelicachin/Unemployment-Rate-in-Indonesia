# Unemployment-Rate-in-Indonesia

Unemployment remains a pressing concern for economic planning and policy formulation in Indonesia. This study delves into analyzing biannually unemployment rate trends from 2013 to 2023, pivotal for addressing socio-economic challenges. Semi-annual data (February and August) sourced from the Central Bureau of Statistics is examined using various time series methods including Naive, Double Moving Average, Double Exponential Smoothing, Time Series Regression, ARIMA, and Neural Networks. Surprisingly, the Neural Network AutoRegressive (NNAR) model has a lag of 1 for autoregression and 1 hidden layer. NNAR(1,1) emerges as the champion. Its ability to capture intricate non-linear relationships leads to superior forecasting accuracy. These findings offer invaluable insights for stakeholders navigating Indonesia's economic landscape, guiding effective policies to combat unemployment and foster sustainable growth. In a world of uncertainty, harnessing advanced forecasting techniques like NNAR is key to shaping a brighter economic future for Indonesia.
